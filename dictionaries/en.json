This dentist, without overtreating, thoroughly checked and explained everything. The dentist spent so much time with me that I wondered if it was too much, which made me trust them. The nurses also played a big role in creating such an atmosphere. They were very kind and detailed in their guidance. I'm planning to settle here for regular check-ups."

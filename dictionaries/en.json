The Zoom2 system uses a high-concentration whitening agent and a professional laser to effectively remove discoloration from teeth, allowing for a noticeably brighter smile in just one visit. The BEAUTIS system activates the whitening gel using visible light, offering quick and excellent whitening results while minimizing gum irritation and sensitivity. These professional whitening methods are ideal for modern individuals who desire quick results without the constraints of time.",
        "p2": "At-home whitening is a convenient whitening method that can be performed at home, provided through the Opalescence At-Home Whitening Kit. This kit includes trays custom-made to fit the individual's teeth and a high-viscosity whitening gel that can be applied directly by the user. The Opalescence whitening gel does not easily drip from the tray, minimizing irritation to the teeth and gums and reducing sensitivity. The whitening effects of at-home whitening typically become apparent after a week, and continued use can gradually make the teeth brighter. At-home whitening is an efficient choice in terms of time and cost, recommended for those who wish to maintain the whitening effect after professional whitening."
